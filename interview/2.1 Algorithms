## Typical Math Questions
- Given a string such as "123" or "67", write a function to output the number represented by the string without using casting.
- Make a program that can print out the text form of numbers from 1 to 9999(ex. 20 is "twenty", "2665 is "two thousand six hundred fifty five")
- How would you convert Roman numerals into decimals?(E.g. XIV becomes 14)
- Compute the square root of an Integer without using any existing built in math functinos.

## Typical Binary Interview Questions
- How do you verify if an integer is a power of 2?
- Write a program to print the binary representations of an integer?
- Write a program to print out the number of 1 bits in a given integer.
- Write a program to determine the next higher integer using the same number of 1 bits in a given number.

## Typical Arrays Interview Questions
- Given an array and an index, find the product of the elements of the array except the element at that index.
- Given 2 seperate arrays, write a method to find the values that exist in both arrays and return them.
- Given an array of numbers, list out all triplets that sum to 0. Do so with a running time of less than O(n^3)
- Given an array of integers, find the subarray with the largest sum
- Find the second maximum value in an array.
- Remove duplicates in an unsorted array where the duplicates are at a distance of k or less from each other.
- Given an unsorted list of integers, return true if the list contains any duplicates within k indices of each element. Do it faster than O(n^2)
- Given an array of string, find the duplicated elements.
- Given an array of integers, modify the arrya by moving all the zeroes to the end(right side). The order of other elements doesn't matter. 
E.G.[1,2,0,3,0,1,2], the program could output[1,2,3,1,2,0,0].
- Given an array of integers where every value appears twice except one, find the single, non-repeating value.
Follow up: do so with O(1) space. E.G\g., [2,5,3,2,1,3,4,5,1] returns 4, beccause it is the only value that appears in the array only once.

# Make sure to be familiar with those algorithms
## Corner Cases
- Strings with only one distinct character.

## Non-repeating Characters
- Use a 26-bit bitmask to indicate which lower case latin characters are inside the string.

## Anagram
- An anagram is word switch or word play.

## Palindrome
- A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward, such as madam or racecar.

## Interval
- Interval quenstions are questions where you are given an array of two-element arrays(an interval) and the two values represent a start and an end vale.
- Interval questions are considered part of the array family but they involve some common techniques hence they are extracted out to this special section of their own.
